# Support Resources

Do not use the issue tracker as a support forum. For any questions that are not specific to the project itself, seek support in the following ways:

- Search for answers and ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions).  
  Some tags related to this project:
  - <code><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vb.net?tab=Frequent">#vb.net</a></code>
  - <code><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio?tab=Frequent">#visual-studio</a></code>
- Use a search engine.
- As a last resort, you may [create a discussion](https://github.com/Strappazzon/GRW-GHOST-Buster/discussions/new?category=questions) on GitHub to ask for help.
  However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem.
