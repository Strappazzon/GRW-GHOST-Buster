# GHOST Buster Contribution Guidelines

:tada: **Thanks for taking the time and effort to make GHOST Backup better!**

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [GHOST Buster Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to `strappazzon [AT] protonmail [DOT] com`.

## Crash, Error, Issue reporting/Feature requests

* Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/Strappazzon/GRW-GHOST-Buster/issues) first to make sure your issue/feature hasn't been reported/requested before. If so, engage in the already existing discussion.
* Check whether your issue/feature is already fixed/implemented.
* Check if the issue still exists in the latest release.
* Issues in languages other than English will be closed and ignored.
* If you are a Visual Basic .Net developer, you are always welcome to fix/implement an issue/feature yourself. PRs are welcome!
* Add one issue at a time. Do not put multiple issues into one thread.
* When reporting a bug please describe the steps which reproduce the problem.
* When reporting an error include the event log from GHOST Buster (**Logs** tab or **event.log** file). Include the logs in the issue in a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests) or put it in a [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.net/) and provide the link to that paste.
* When reporting a crash include the stack trace from GHOST Buster (click the "**â–¼ Details**" button in the crash window). Include the stack trace in the issue in a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests), or put it in a [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.net/) and provide the link to that paste.

## Code Contribution

* Make changes on a separate branch, not on the master branch, then send your changes as a pull request.
* When submitting changes, you confirm that your code is licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* Please test (compile and run) your code before you submit changes. Untested code will **not** be merged!
* Make sure your PR is up-to-date with the rest of the code.

## Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Reference issues and pull requests after the first line.
* When only changing the website or README file, start the commit message with `docs:` ("docs: Update index.html").
